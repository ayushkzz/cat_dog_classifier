# üê±üê∂ Cats vs Dogs Deep Learning Classifier

## Project Overview

This project is a deep learning-based image classifier that distinguishes between cats and dogs using the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset. It features both a custom CNN and a transfer learning model (MobileNetV2) for robust and accurate classification. The solution includes a Flask backend for serving predictions and a React frontend for user-friendly image uploads and results display.

## Key Features

- Custom CNN model for baseline performance.
- Transfer learning with MobileNetV2 for improved accuracy.
- Data preprocessing with augmentation.
- Flask backend API for image prediction.
- React frontend for image upload and displaying predictions.

## Usage

1. Train the models or load pre-trained weights.
2. Use the Flask API to serve predictions.
3. Upload images via the React frontend to get predictions with confidence scores.

## Deployment

- Backend can be deployed on platforms like Render, Railway, PythonAnywhere, or Koyeb.
- Frontend can be deployed on Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages.
